This project presents \textbf{SIREN (Smart Incident Response \& Event Notifier)}, an integrated security incident management platform designed to address critical challenges faced by Security Operations Centers in detecting, correlating, and responding to security incidents. Modern organizations struggle with alert overload, manual event correlation, and fragmented visibility across disparate security tools, resulting in delayed incident response and increased risk exposure.

SIREN provides an automated solution combining event collection from Windows endpoints, intelligent correlation algorithms, and coordinated incident response workflows within a unified web-based platform. The system architecture comprises a React TypeScript frontend, Python FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database, and lightweight Python agents.

Key capabilities include automated pattern detection, real-time dashboards, prioritized alerting, and integrated investigation tools, making sophisticated incident response capabilities accessible to organizations without the complexity and cost of enterprise SIEM solutions.
