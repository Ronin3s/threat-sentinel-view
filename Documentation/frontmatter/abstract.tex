This project presents SIREN (Smart Incident Response \& Event Notifier), an integrated security incident management platform designed to address critical challenges faced by Security Operations Centers in detecting, correlating, and responding to security incidents. Modern organizations struggle with alert overload, manual event correlation, and fragmented visibility across disparate security tools, resulting in delayed incident response and increased risk exposure.

SIREN provides an automated solution that combines event collection from Windows endpoints, intelligent correlation algorithms, and coordinated incident response workflows within a unified web-based platform. The system architecture comprises a React TypeScript frontend, Python FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database, and lightweight Python agents for Windows event collection. Key capabilities include automated pattern detection, real-time dashboards, prioritized alerting, and integrated investigation tools.

The platform successfully demonstrates effective integration of security event management with modern web technologies, making sophisticated incident response capabilities accessible to small and medium enterprises without the complexity and cost of enterprise SIEM solutions. Through comprehensive requirements analysis and system design, SIREN provides a targeted, practical approach to security incident management that balances capability with simplicity.
